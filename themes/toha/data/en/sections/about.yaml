# a summary about you
summary: 'I am a software developer who aspires to learn more about the whole Artificial Intelligence field and apply
 that understanding to contribute to open source projects that deal with AI. I interned with NetApp a few years ago, 
 adding UI features to the Swagger API. Through this experience, I learned how to most appropriately contribute to 
 open source projects, which was to use the Git model in a way that adhered to contribution guidelines. I also added 
 to GatorMiner, which is an open source project that performs a textual analysis of markdown files, including 
 sentimental analysis. For my undergraduate senior comprehensive project, I focused on hyperparameter optimization of
  neural networks that deal with time series datasets. I won the Zingale Big Idea Competition, a business 
  pitch competition, by developing a tool called GrandSlam AI, which currently takes a video of people playing 
  tennis and performs object detection of the player, the court, and the ball. Future development will include 
  advanced statistics, such as the average speed of the ball, spin frequency, area frequency, etc.'
